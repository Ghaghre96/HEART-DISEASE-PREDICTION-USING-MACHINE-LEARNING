# Predicting Heart Diseases using Machine Learning and Gradient Boosting Methods

## Abstract

This abstract presents a study on predicting heart diseases using machine learning and gradient boosting methods. The study utilizes three popular gradient boosting algorithms, namely LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, to train predictive models. The results indicate that LightGBM outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy. The study highlights the potential of using advanced machine learning techniques for early detection of heart diseases, which can lead to timely intervention and improved health outcomes.

## Introduction

Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death worldwide. It refers to a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and a family history of the condition. Early prediction and diagnosis of heart disease can improve patient outcomes and prevent complications.

## Machine Learning for Heart Disease Prediction

Machine learning techniques, particularly gradient boosting algorithms, can be used to analyze large amounts of patient data and identify patterns that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. In this study, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost are employed to develop predictive models for heart disease.

## Results

The results of the study indicate that LightGBM demonstrates superior predictive accuracy compared to XGBoost and CatBoost. This finding underscores the effectiveness of LightGBM in the context of heart disease prediction.

## Conclusion

Overall, this study highlights the potential of machine learning methods for predicting heart disease and improving patient care. Early detection facilitated by these techniques can lead to timely interventions and ultimately better health outcomes.
